# NBA All Average Team Project

This is a project by David Roycroft and Billy Fryer. We are students at North Carolina State University in the Sports Analytics Club there. This project was presented at the
first ever SAC Poster Competition in April 2021. It did not place, but several judges commented that the project was under consideration.

The project focuses on the idea of a statistically average NBA Team. The idea stems from the NBA naming All-NBA teams every year.

To do this, we took a players per game stats and then scale them between 0 and 1 in comparison to other players in the league. We then summed all of these scaled scores into 1 total that we called SScD (Sum of Scaled Differences). The interpretation being that that the lower a player's SScD is, the more average they were. For a summary of the report, feel free to look at our Poster or the slides in this repository!

While finishing the project, we ran into a time crunch, so I am currently going back through and properly commenting and making the code more readable, but feel
